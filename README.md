# The Endless Yarn

The Endless Yarn is a personal project done during my learning period at DCI _(https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/de/)_.

## Objective:

The goal of the project is to create a responsive website applying my knowledge of `React`, `CSS` and `HTML`.

## Components:

1. **App Container**:
   It contains all the logic of the website. The components have access to this information through the Hook `useContext`.

2. **Navbar**: Responsive Navbar which in mobile view shows an interactive hamburger menu.

3. **Carousel**:
   Component that allows by using two buttons `next` and `previous` to visualize images in a predetermined order.

4. **ProjectsData**:
   Under construction... It will contain the information of the woven projects that I have realized in my free time.
