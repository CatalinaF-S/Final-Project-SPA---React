# The Endless Yarn

The Endless Yarn is a personal project done during my learning period at DCI _(https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/de/)_ to finalize the Single Page Application module.

## Objective:

The goal of the project is to create a responsive website applying my knowledge of `React`, `CSS` and `HTML`.

## Components:

1. **App Container**:
   It contains all the logic of the website. The components have access to this information through the Hook `useContext`.

2. **Navbar**:
   Responsive Navbar which in mobile view shows an interactive hamburger menu.

4. **Carousel**:
   Component that allows to visualize images in a predetermined order by using two buttons `next` and `previous` .

5. **ProjectsData**:
   Under construction... It will contain the information of the woven projects that I have realized in my free time.
